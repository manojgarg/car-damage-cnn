# Car Damage using CNN

Using machine vision and deep learning, created a proof of concept to speed up the personal auto claims procedure. Damage location and severity were accurately identified with 79 percent and 71% accuracy, respectively, comparable to human performance. To classify damage, I used Keras and Theano to train a pipeline of convolutional neural networks using transfer learning on VGG16. For real-time car damage evaluations, I used Flask and Bootstrap to build a consumer-facing web app. Data scraped with Selenium from Google Images, hand-labeled for classification, and supplemented with the Stanford Car Image Dataset. Using machine vision and deep learning, created a proof of concept to speed up the personal auto claims procedure. Damage location and severity were accurately identified with 79 percent and 71% accuracy, respectively, comparable to human performance.Â
